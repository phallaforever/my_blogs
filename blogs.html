        <h2 class="article center-pre-header">Learing Track 1: How Much Does IT Matter?</h2>
        <p class="article paragraph-one">In May 2003, Nicholas Carr, an editor at Harvard Business Review, wrote an
            article
            titled “IT Doesn’t Matter,” which stirred significant debate in the business community. Carr’s argument in a
            nutshell is that because every fi rm can purchase IT in the marketplace, because any advantage obtained by
            one company can easily be copied by another company, and because IT is now a commodity based on standards
            (such as the Internet) that all companies can freely use, it is no longer a differentiating factor in
            organizational performance. Carr argues that no fi rm can use IT to achieve a strategic edge over its
            competitors any more than it could with electricity, telephones, or other infrastructure. Therefore, Carr
            concludes, fi rms should reduce spending on IT, follow rather than lead IT in their industry, reduce risks
            by preparing for computer outages and security breaches, and avoid deploying IT in new ways. </p>

        <p class="article paragraph-two">In 2013, how does Carr’s argument stand up?</p>
        <p class="article paragraph-three">Most management information system (MIS) experts disagree. As we discuss
            later in this chapter and subsequent chapters throughout the book, research demonstrates that there is
            considerable variation in fi rms’ ability to use IT effectively. Many highly adept fi rms continually obtain
            superior returns on their investment in IT, whereas less adept firms do not. Copying innovations of other fi
            rms can be devilishly difficult, with much being lost in the translation. Th ere is only one Google, one
            Wal-Mart, one Amazon, and one eBay, and each of these fi rms has achieved a competitive advantage in its
            industry based in large part on unique ways of organizing work enabled by IT that have been very difficult
            to copy. Many very powerful fi rms have tried to copy each of these dominant firms without success. If
            copying were so easy, we would expect to find much more powerful competition for these market leaders. It’s
            also the case that these fi rms have often failed to move out of their niche products by imitating others.

        <p class="article paragraph-five">Although falling prices for hardware and software and new computing and
            telecommunications standards such as the Internet have made the application of computers to business much
            easier than in the past, this does not signal the end of innovation or the end of firms developing strategic
            edges using IT. Far from the end of innovation, commoditization often leads to an explosion in innovation
            and new markets and products. For example, the abundance and availability of materials such as wood, glass,
            and steel during the last century made possible a continuing stream of architectural innovation. Likewise,
            the widespread availability of cloud computing in 2013, a good example of commodity computing, is leading to
            thousands of new products and services. Th e same can be said with mobile phones and tablets.</p>
        <p class="article paragraph-six">Likewise, the development of standards and lowering costs of computer hardware
            made possible new products and services such as the Apple iPhone, tablet computers, iTunes, online streaming
            music and video, and the entire online content industry. Entirely new businesses and business models have
            emerged for the digital distribution of music, books, newspapers, radio, journals, and Hollywood films.
            Carris surely correct in stating that not all investments in IT work out or have strategic value. Some are
            just needed to stay in business, to comply with government reporting requirements, and to satisfy the needs
            of customers and vendors (often raising costs and depressing profits for a period of time). Therefore, yes,
            not all IT investments lead to strategic advantages. Most IT investment is not intended to lead to strategic
            advantages.
        </p>
        <p class="article paragraph-seven">Perhaps the more important questions in 2013 are how much does IT make a
            difference, in what industries and firms, and where can it best be deployed to make a competitive
            difference?
            Why do some firms achieve a strategic edge with information systems, and some fi rms do not?
        </p>
        <p class="article paragraph-eigh">We make a major effort in this book to suggest ways you as a manager and
            potential entrepreneur can use information technology and systems to create differentiation from your
            competitors and strategic advantage for your firm in the marketplace. As we describe throughout, to achieve
            any measure of “success,” investment in IT must be accompanied by significant changes in business operations
            and processes and changes in management culture, attitudes, and behavior. Absent these changes, investment
            in IT can be a waste of precious investor resources. </p>
